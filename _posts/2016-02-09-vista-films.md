Right now I am a full-time student at Azusa Pacific University majoring in their Bachelor of Fine Arts Program in Cinematography. I was Director of Videography for a mega church called Bayside Granite Bay, in Northern California before I left for college. I'm still on staff with them doing shoots as needed as well as working on my own doing wedding videos; and recently I finished a week-long location shoot in Tennessee for a national youth convention. One of the biggest projects I just finished up, is the first episode for a web series on sex trafficking. It's in the process of being picked up by a major studio and we are scheduled to film seven more episodes within the next four months.

I started pursuing photography when I was 15 and started taking pictures of sunsets with my iPhone. The more pictures I took the more I wanted to learn about photography. A professional photographer stepped in and started teaching me about photography and the basics of the trade. As I got better at photography I started to gain interest in cinematography. The more I filmed the more I loved it and wanted to pursue it because I found I could bring images to life. I also discovered that my ADD worked to my advantage in this area because I was able to see everything going on around me, where most people could only focus on one thing at a time. As I got better, my high school leaders noticed and gave me free access to the church's video equipment and I started doing video for them.
