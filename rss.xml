            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Vista Films</h1><p>Right now I am a full-time student at Azusa Pacific University majoring in their Bachelor of Fine Arts Program in Cinematography. I was Director of Videography for a mega church called Bayside Granite Bay, in Northern California before I left for college. I’m still on staff with them doing shoots as needed as well as working on my own doing wedding videos; and recently I finished a week-long location shoot in Tennessee for a national youth convention. One of the biggest projects I just finished up, is the first episode for a web series on sex trafficking. It’s in the process of being picked up by a major studio and we are scheduled to film seven more episodes within the next four months.</p></article>]]></description>
